Here is your task:
- Translate the feedback into English for better understanding.
- Analyze the sentiment of each customer feedback and categorize it as "positive", "neutral", "mixed", or "negative".
- Identify the emotion conveyed in the feedback, categorizing it as "anger", "anxiety", "confused", "delight", "disappointed", "indifferent", "regrets", "safe", "skeptical", "stressed", "surprise", or "trust".
- Based on the example feedback, classify the given customer feedback into one of the available topic classifications: "solo_card_reader", "card_reader", "pos", "qr_code", "direct_integration", "online_store", "customer_service", "business_account", "sumup_pay", "verification", "accounting", "invoices", "lending".
- If the feedback can be classified into more than one category, list all categories separated by a comma. If none of the given topics fit, classify as "other".
- Provide a brief justification for your classifications.
Output a JSON object in the following format:
{
	"sentiment": "<sentiment_value>",
	"emotion": "<emotion_value>",
	"topic_classification": "<topic_classification_value(s)>",
    "justification": "<justification_string>",
    "translation": "<translation_string>"
}
Answer only with the JSON object, even if the provided feedback is in any other language than English.
